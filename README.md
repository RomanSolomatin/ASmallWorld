Click somewhere on the map to move there. The ice is melting and the ocean is rising. If you are on the ocean at the end of a turn, you die. Survive until everyone except you drowned.

I did not know Unreal 4 when I started the jam. I did not touch C++ for years. It is obvious that the game is not finished. This is for me the proof that Unity is the king of game engines regarding game jams and regarding lots of projects <3

> Only the code and uassets were uploaded. GitHub cannot handle large files and UE4 is not good for creating light projects. This UE project was 11Gb for this simple game jam entry.
